Mobile app for iOS environment.
â€¢	A mobile application which is presenting popular movies. It has written using Swift. It uses TMDB API. The user can search the movies and see the details about it. Also, can add the favorite movies to own offline list. I have used Core Data and Alamofire libraries for this project.
